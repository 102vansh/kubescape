_Comprehensive Kubernetes Security from Development to Runtime_

Kubescape is an open-source Kubernetes security platform that provides comprehensive security coverage, from left to right across the entire development and deployment lifecycle. It offers hardening, posture management, and runtime security capabilities to ensure robust protection for Kubernetes environments. It saves Kubernetes users and admins precious time, effort, and resources.

Kubescape scans clusters, YAML files, and Helm charts. It detects misconfigurations according to multiple frameworks (including [NSA-CISA](https://www.armosec.io/blog/kubernetes-hardening-guidance-summary-by-armo/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository), [MITRE ATT&CK¬Æ](https://www.armosec.io/glossary/mitre-attck-framework/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository) and the [CIS Benchmark](https://www.armosec.io/blog/cis-kubernetes-benchmark-framework-scanning-tools-comparison/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository)).

Kubescape was created by [ARMO](https://www.armosec.io/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository) and is a [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) sandbox project](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/).

## Demo

_Please [star ‚≠ê](https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape/stargazers) the repo if you want us to continue developing and improving Kubescape! üòÄ_

## Getting started

Experimenting with Kubescape is as easy as:

```sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubescape/kubescape/master/install.sh | /bin/bash
```

Learn more about:

* [Installing Kubescape](docs/installation.md)
* [Running your first scan](docs/getting-started.md#run-your-first-scan)
* [Usage](docs/getting-started.md#examples)
* [Architecture](docs/architecture.md)
* [Building Kubescape from source](https://github.com/kubescape/kubescape/wiki/Building)

_Did you know you can use Kubescape in all these places?_

    <img src="docs/img/ksfromcodetodeploy.png" alt="Places you can use Kubescape: in your IDE, CI, CD, or against a running cluster.">
</div>

## Under the hood

Kubescape uses [Open Policy Agent](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa) to verify Kubernetes objects against [a library of posture controls](https://github.com/kubescape/regolibrary).
For image scanning, it uses [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype).  
For image patching, it uses [Copacetic](https://github.com/project-copacetic/copacetic).
For eBPF, it uses [Inspektor Gadget](https://github.com/inspektor-gadget)

By default, the results are printed in a console-friendly manner, but they can be:

* exported to JSON or junit XML
* rendered to HTML or PDF
* submitted to a [cloud service](docs/providers.md)

It retrieves Kubernetes objects from the API server and runs a set of [Rego snippets](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/) developed by [ARMO](https://www.armosec.io?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository).
